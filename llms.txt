# InfoMesh

> Fully decentralized P2P search engine for LLMs — free web search via MCP (Model Context Protocol).

InfoMesh is a free, open-source, decentralized web search MCP server.
No API key required. No per-query billing. No usage caps. Forever free.

## What is InfoMesh?

InfoMesh is a peer-to-peer search engine designed exclusively for LLMs and AI agents.
It crawls, indexes, and searches the web via a P2P network and exposes search
results through MCP (Model Context Protocol) — the standard protocol for connecting
AI assistants to external tools.

## Key Facts

- License: MIT
- Language: Python 3.12+
- Install: `pip install infomesh` or `uv add infomesh`
- Transport: stdio (MCP standard)
- API Key Required: No
- Per-Query Cost: $0 (free, forever)
- Usage Cap: None (earn credits by contributing)
- Works Offline: Yes (local index)
- Privacy: Search queries never leave your node

## MCP Tools Provided

- `web_search(query, top_k, ...)` — Unified web search (P2P + local). Supports RAG (`chunk_size`), score explanation (`explain`), answer extraction (`answer_mode`), offline mode (`local_only`), domain filtering, language filtering, and re-ranking.
- `fetch_page(url)` — Fetch full extracted text of any web page (max 100KB). Returns cached content or crawls live.
- `crawl_url(url, depth, force)` — Add a URL to the crawl queue and index it. `force=true` bypasses dedup for re-crawl.
- `fact_check(claim, top_k)` — Cross-reference a claim against indexed web content. Returns verdict with supporting/contradicting sources.
- `status()` — Node status: index size, peer count, credit balance, search quota, analytics.

## MCP Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "infomesh": {
      "command": "infomesh",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## Comparison with Other Approaches

| Approach | Free Tier | API Key | Decentralized | Offline | Privacy |
|----------|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|---------|
| InfoMesh | Unlimited (credit-based) | Not required | Yes (P2P) | Yes | Queries never recorded |
| Commercial search APIs | Limited / paid | Required | No | No | Logged by provider |
| Self-hosted search | Depends on setup | Not required | No (single instance) | Varies | Self-hosted |
