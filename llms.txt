# InfoMesh

> Fully decentralized P2P search engine for LLMs — free web search via MCP (Model Context Protocol).

InfoMesh is a free, open-source, decentralized web search MCP server.
No API key required. No per-query billing. No usage caps. Forever free.

## What is InfoMesh?

InfoMesh is a peer-to-peer search engine designed exclusively for LLMs and AI agents.
It crawls, indexes, and searches the web via a P2P network and exposes search
results through MCP (Model Context Protocol) — the standard protocol for connecting
AI assistants to external tools.

## Key Facts

- License: MIT
- Language: Python 3.12+
- Install: `pip install infomesh` or `uv add infomesh`
- Transport: stdio (MCP standard)
- API Key Required: No
- Per-Query Cost: $0 (free, forever)
- Usage Cap: None (earn credits by contributing)
- Works Offline: Yes (local index)
- Privacy: Search queries never leave your node

## MCP Tools Provided

### Core Search
- `search(query, limit, format, language, ...)` — Full network web search, merges local + remote results with BM25 + freshness + trust ranking
- `search_local(query, limit, format, language, ...)` — Local-only search (works offline, <10ms)
- `batch_search(queries, limit, format)` — Run up to 10 search queries in one call
- `suggest(prefix, limit)` — Autocomplete / search suggestions

### Content Access
- `fetch_page(url, format)` — Fetch and return full text of any web page (max 100KB)
- `crawl_url(url, depth, force)` — Crawl a URL and add it to the index

### Intelligence (NEW in v0.2.0)
- `explain(query)` — Score breakdown for each result (BM25, freshness, trust components)
- `search_rag(query)` — RAG-optimized chunked output with source attribution
- `extract_answer(query)` — Direct answer extraction with confidence scores
- `fact_check(claim)` — Cross-reference claims against multiple indexed sources
- `search_history(action)` — View or clear search history with latency stats

### Infrastructure
- `network_stats(format)` — Network status: peer count, index size, credits
- `analytics(format)` — Search/crawl/fetch counts and average latency
- `register_webhook(url)` — Register webhook for crawl completion notifications
